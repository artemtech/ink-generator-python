# Example files for Generator Extension

Some example files that help clarify a bit how the extension works.

## Some additional hints

* do not use spaces between the columns
* link any image that you want to use as a placeholder (don't embed)
* put the replacement images into the same directory as the placeholder, so you
only need to replace the name
